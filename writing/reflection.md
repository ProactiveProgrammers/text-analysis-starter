# Text Analysis

TODO: Make sure that your GitHub repository contains the following text files:

- `generated_one.txt`: provided as part of the project
- `generated_two.txt`: you generate this file by running `textanalysis`
- `input_one.txt`: provided as part of this project
- `input_two.txt`: human-written text that you excerpt from a source or write yourself

TODO: You must use a command like `git add` to ensure that two files exist in the repository

TODO: Make sure that your GitHub repository contains the following graphics files:

- `set-visualization-generated.png`: visualization created by `textanalysis` for the file `generated_one.txt`
- `set-visualization-input.png`: visualization created by `textanalysis` for the file `input_one.txt`
